# InstaQuote

A platform to help businesses make a dynamic pricing for their customer. So their customer get instant quote order based on their uploaded files instantly

## Inspiration

Aldhaneka experienced the long process of quoting and how they asked Aldhaneka to send the file to their email even despite Aldhaneka has sent it through WhatsApp. Also, the time taken to quote seems to be pretty long, which might make customers very frustrated and use a competitor’s services instead.

## What it does

It simplify the process of quoting by giving a dynamic pricing, giving a dynamic pricing, benefiting both parties and customer that wants a quick quote and business that has a small chance of mistake.

## How we built it

We built this platform with a team of 4; Aldhaneka as the Project Lead, Dave, Haroki, and Satria. Aldhaneka and Haroki responsible for the front-end side which includes Authentication, Dashboard and UI, while Satria and Dave responsible in the back-end side which provides the REST API communications between two environments. 

We built the front-end on top of Next.js Framework, and we use Express.js with the binding of TypeScript to keep our project safe and easy to understand.

## Challenges we ran into

- Database
    We stumbled migrating different database services in the first 8 hours of hackathon due to the free-tier package is not sufficient enough to support our development phase, we eventually used Neon Serverless Postgres database because it’s easy to manage and has enough resources on the free-tier to use for our development phase.
    
- Project Collaboration
    Garuda Hacks 6.0 was our very first hackathon to each one of us, we have never had an intense fast-paced project before. On the first 4 hours after the kickoff at 2 pm on the 24th July, we spent a lot of time just to figure out how to work effectively with given assigned task in one project repository folder. We faced a lot of problems in this process including slow internet (*~~please send help~~*)*.*
    
- Feature Integration
    Although we tried integrating WhatsApp at first, we didn’t manage to make that happen due to time constraints and lack of documentation. Also, the Baileys documentation for some reason is empty (we have no idea why).
    

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud that we are able to finish this project in time (aside from the sleep deprivation and the eyebags we got), learning how to use SQL and Drizzle ORM, being able to team up and make a project together within 30 hours and make a dynamic builder for businesses to make their pricing dynamic.

## What we learned
We learned how teamwork can become really helpful as long as you communicate. We believe that communication is really important in teamwork.
From the technical side, because every person here kind of came from different background of engineering, we learned a lot of stuff from each other.

## What's next for InstaQuote?
We hope to be able to make InstaQuote used by printing services from all around the world while including more features one step at a time.

## Credits & Attributes

We came up with this idea fully from our own experience and pain as customer who use printing services that is so painful to wait for the price to comes up from their customer service.
